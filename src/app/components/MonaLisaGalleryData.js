    description: 'The Mona Lisa, also known as La Gioconda, is one of the most iconic paintings in the world. Created by the Italian Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1506, it is renowned for its subjectâ€™s mysterious expression, the innovative use of sfumato (a smoky blending technique), and the illusion of depth. The woman depicted is believed to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine merchant. Housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, this oil painting on a poplar wood panel has captivated audiences for centuries and remains a symbol of artistic genius and cultural heritage.',

    additionalInfo: 'The painting is thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel and is believed to have been commissioned for their new home and to celebrate the birth of their second son. The painting features a seated woman whose facial expression is often described as enigmatic. The ambiguity of the subject\'s expression, the monumentality of the composition, and the subtle modeling of forms and atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work. The painting has been housed at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France since 1797.',
